```

## Usage:

### Declare component

```html
<script>
	export default {
		components: {
			GlitchedWriter,
		},
	}
</script>
```

### Animate text instantly after load

Will animate blank -> passed text property

```html
<glitched-writer text="Your Content" appear />
```

### Write text dynamically

Previous text -> new text

```html
<glitched-writer :text="text" />
```

```js
{
   data() {
      return {
         text: 'Your dynamic text.'
      }
   },
   mounted() {
      setTimeout(() => {
         this.text = 'Something new!'
         // Glitched Writer will animate this text change
      }, 3000)
   }
}
```

### Using Presets

[List of available presets](https://github.com/thetarnav/glitched-writer#presets).

```html
<glitched-writer text="Your Text" preset="zalgo" />

<!-- Passing options prop will extend the preset -->
<glitched-writer text="Your Text" preset="zalgo" :options="{ html: true }" />
```

### Custom Options

See [Glitched Writer's Option List](https://github.com/thetarnav/glitched-writer#customizing-behavior).

#### **Passing options object to component.**

```js
{
   data() {
      return {
         text: 'Your Text',
         options: {
            html: true,
            letterize: true,
            steps: [0, 10],
            initialDelay: [500, 2000],
            glyphs: 'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM!@#$%^&*()1234567890'
         },
      }
   },
}
```

```html
<glitched-writer :text="text" :options="options" />
```

#### **Changing options later**

When changing options object (passed to the component), you need to remember to reassign the object property, instead of modifying it.

```js
{
   methods: {
      changeOprions(){
         // RIGHT
         this.options = {
            steps: [2, 15],
            html: false
         }

         // WRONG: this.options.steps = [2, 15]
      }
   }
}
```

### Pausing the animation

The "pause" boolean property is responsible for programatic pausing.
Simply set "pause" property to true if you want the animation to stop.

```js
{
   data() {
      return {
         pause: true
      }
   },
}
```

```html
<glitched-writer :text="text" :pause="pause" />
```

### Component Events

Glitched Writer emits event on every **step** and writing **finish**.

```html
<glitched-writer :text="text" @step="method" @finish="method" />
```

```ts
{
   methods: {
      method(currentString: string, writerData: WriterDataResponse){
         console.log(currentString, writerData.options)
      }
   }
}

// WriterDataResponse: {
// 	string: string
// 	writer: GlitchedWriter
// 	options: Options
// 	state: State
// 	status?: 'ERROR' | 'SUCCESS'
// 	message?: string
// 	error?: any
// }
```
